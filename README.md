Packaging the application

Before releasing
1) change package.json version
2) check public/electron.js is set to production
3) npm run build
4) git add . -> ... -> git push
5) npm run dist

```
npm run dist
```

Unsure about process.env.NODE_ENV, for now its set in environment folder as a variable

Issues
1. Preload.js can fail if a required package has issues. Delete one by one and ensure its loading

2. HashRouter instead of BrowserRouter if you are using files as a path.

3. Production and development environment can be a pain, better to just have 2 files and use whatever one is needed.

4. Building using npx electron-builder seems to be a much better choice over npm.

5. packaged & wont open, try npm run dev, if the app opens its listening on 
localhost:XXXX, ensure file path is correct. Revert back to issue 1. if needed.

6. Package.json file may require a "homapage": "./", while your there check main is also correct, "public/electron.js"

7. Made 2 files one for production and development in electron.js and swtich between the two less prone to bugs but more annoying.

8. Releasing to GITHUB and the app starts having DAMAGE problems?
    - xattr path/to/applciation.app
    com.apple.provenance → macOS knows it came from the internet (Safari, Chrome, etc.).
    com.apple.quarantine → Gatekeeper has locked it and won’t let it run because it’s
    - xattr -cr path/to/applciation.app
    to then remove and allow it to work again
